## SUBJECT
The client, Awesome Chocolate, seeks to reduce costs by identifying and eliminating low-profit areas in production and sales. Specifically, the aim is to streamline operations by focusing on profitable products and high-performing sales personnel, ultimately enhancing the company's overall profitability.

## TASK
Develop a Power BI dashboard to effectively visualize product and sales data, enabling the identification of key trends and supporting data-driven decision-making.

## ACTION
### Product Profitability Analysis:
Identify the chocolate products with the lowest profit margins. Based on this analysis, recommend the discontinuation of those products that contribute minimally to the company's profitability, thereby reducing production and inventory costs.

### Salesperson Profitability Evaluation:
Assess the profitability generated by each salesperson, with a view to identify the individual with the lowest profit contribution. Based on this insight, consider a strategic layoff of underperforming sales personnel, reducing the operational cost associated with sales.

## RESULT

## SOLUTION
### Discontinue Baker's Choco Chips:
Cease production of Baker's Choco Chips due to consistently low performance across all six regions. This will allow the company to allocate resources more effectively toward higher-performing products.

### Regional Product Focus:
Sales of chocolate products vary significantly by region. To maximize sales, prioritize popular products tailored to regional preferences, thereby enhancing market-specific growth and boosting overall sales.

### Retain Employee Ches Bonnell:
With a substantial profit contribution of $654K (53.6%), retaining Ches Bonnell is essential to avoid potential negative impacts on profitability.

### Targeted Regional Assignment for Ches Bonnell:
Assign Ches Bonnell to focus on Australia, New Zealand, and the UK, where his performance has been notably strong, to capitalize on his strengths and maximize regional sales growth.
